# Searching Practice Problems

1. **Product of a Number and Its Previous Number Using Linear Search**

    Given an array of integers, write a program to calculate the product of a particular number and its previous number using linear search.

    - Sample Input: `[1, 4, 5, 7, 8, -2, 6, 0, 19, -15]`
    
    - Number: `5`
    
    - Output: `5 * 4 = 20`


2. **Find the Smallest Missing Non-Negative Element Using Binary Search**

    Given a sorted array of non-negative distinct integers, find the smallest missing non-negative element in it using binary search.

    - Input: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15]`
    
    - Output: `The smallest missing element is 5`


3. **Sum of a Number and Three Following Numbers Using Linear Search**

    Given an array of integers, write a program to calculate the sum of a particular number and three numbers following that number using linear search.

    - Sample Input: `1, 4, 5, 7, 8, -2, 6, 0, 19, -15`
    
    - Number: `5`
    
    - Output: `5 + 7 + 8 - 2 = 18`


4. **Count Repetitions of Positive Numbers Using Binary Search**

    Determine the number of repetitions of the positive numbers from an array, using binary search.

    - Sample Input: `-5, -4, -4, -3, -3, -3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10`
    
    - Output:
    ```
    Number: 5 Count: 4
    Number: 8 Count: 2
    ```
